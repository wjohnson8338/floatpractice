        <p class="leftSideText" id="surprisedcat">BOO! This Cat is searching for something! What could this cat be searching for tho? Treasure? The Apple of Eden? I find myself very curious. This cat is lurking in a jungle, so maybe the cat is searching for some ancient mayan ruins!!! Nonetheless it's such a cuuuuute cat!! However be warned, this cat does not like to be sneaked up upon, so give em a warning before you scare mr cat away. </p>

        <p class="leftSideText" id="breadcat">Oh nooo!!! This cat got their head stuck inside the bread while examining it! Haha just kidding, this cat is playing dress up and thought that a piece of bread would be a great costume. This cat is a little more adolscent then the other cats and often finds these fun pasttimes to indulge in. </p>
        <img class="formatleft" src="images/download (1).jfif">
        <p class="rightSideText" id="smartcat">Ah yes the intellectual cat. This cat is very wise, they actually got placed in the Ravenclaw household on an online harry potter quiz. This cat is as intellectual as they get having a college GPA of 6.0. I know.. you can't even get that high, that's why its amazing. The Intellectual Cat is very kind to others, and definitley a great friend to be with.</p>

        <p class="leftSideText" id="blackcat">Oh no!! Someone feed this cat. The black cat is a little angry because they haven't been fed their fancy feast. If I were you my best advice is to take a trip to your local stop &amp; shop and get this cat some food. If not they may try to breach the kitchen and take food from the fridge. Mmm some nice fish would do pretty nice for the cat right now! </p>
